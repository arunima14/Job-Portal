We give engineers product analytics, session recording, feature flags, A/B testing, event pipelines, SQL access, and a data warehouse… and there’s plenty more to come.</p>\n<p>PostHog was created as an open-source project during Y Combinator's W20 cohort and had the most successful B2B software launch on HackerNews since 2012 - with a product that was just 4 weeks old. Since then, more than 35,000 companies have installed the platform. We've had huge success with our paid upgrades, raised $27m from some of the world's top investors, and have shown strong product-led growth - 97% driven by word of mouth. </p>\n<p>Despite the 📉 tech market, we're default alive and doing better than ever!</p>\n<p>PostHog makes money from our cloud product, or people can self host the open source project. We average 10% monthly revenue growth and are aiming for $10m ARR in early 2024. While others are focused on layoffs and struggling to grow into huge valuations, we're focusing on an awesome product for end users, hiring a handful of exceptional team members, and seeing fantastic increases in revenue as a result.</p>\n<h2><strong>What we value</strong></h2>\n<p>We are <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values#we-are-open-source\">open source</a> - building a huge community around a free-for-life product is key to PostHog's strategy.\nWe aim to become the most transparent company, ever.

US hedge funds account for $3.5T of assets but rely upon antiquated services and technology from fractured service providers, and there's an enormous opportunity to challenge longstanding incumbents and gain significant market share.</p>\n<p>Founded in 2021, Repool is a YC S21 with over $4M in funding from top firms like Canaan, Matrix, and Uncorrelated, as well as angel investors including founders from unicorns like Brex, Jeeves, Mercury, Flexport, Outschool, Pilot, and Forge.</p>\n<p>The team currently has 8 employees, primarily in NYC.  This role will be in-person approximately 4 days a week in NYC.</p>\n<p><strong>THE ROLE:</strong></p>\n<p>We're hiring for an organized, smart, and ambitious junior account executive to join our team as our second business-facing hire.  We're open to taking a bet on someone who has not yet been an AE and is trying to advance their career and learn real sales skills - which, in candor, many tech companies do not teach.</p>\n<p>At Repool, you'll own and run a primarily inbound based deal funnel end-to-end, working directly with emerging and existing fund managers, typically in the range of single digit to double digit millions of assets.  You'll develop highly transferable skills, learn complex regulatory and legal frameworks, and bring managers onto the Repool platform.</p>\n<p>Our co-founder, Kevin Fu, is an award-winning sales executive who has been the first sales hire at an early stage startup twice, including as the Head of Revenue at Vitally.  He's built out SDR and AE teams and you'll work closely with him to build out your sales skillset and become an exceptional salesperson.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT YOU'LL DO HERE</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Help establish and influence growth processes across both pre-sale business development and post-sale client success</li>\n<li>Find ways to build demand and interest from prospective fund managers</li>\n<li>Work with prospective clients to help them understand the fund services landscale and why they should work with Repool</li>\n<li>Onboard new clients end-to-end, helping them launch their own fund</li>\n<li>Learn and navigate sophisticated regulatory and legal frameworks associated with the investment management and fund formation space</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>THE RIGHT CANDIDATE WILL HAVE:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>**1-2 years of post-graduate experience, including at least 12 months in an entry-level or higher sales capacity.

We don't want joining early to mean critical concessions in security or your well being.  Consequently, we're proud to offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Highly competitive salary relative to experience and the role, and a meaningful equity stake</li>\n<li>100% covered, top-of-the-line health insurance, dental, and vision</li>\n<li>401k w/match</li>\n<li>100% covered life insurance, short-term disability insurance, and long-term disability insurance.</li>\n<li>Commuter benefits</li>\n<li>Optional critical illness, voluntary life insurance supplement, accident, and hospital insurance options</li>\n<li>Unlimited PTO</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO US:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Leaning in.</strong>  Startups aren't where you go to make the absolute most money, have the best work-life balance, or the easiest role.  That's not for everyone, but the worst situation is people who join startups wanting only the \"upsides\" and not the \"downsides.\".  You should know that building a startup is hard, and while we aim to have work-life balance, this just isn't a 9-5 job, and it's also not a role where you can coast.  Great companies that become unicorns universally have incredible early employees who leaned in and helped build the company.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Culture.</strong>  Between the two of us, we've been at companies with great culture, okay culture, and bad culture, and while there's no one way to have an amazing culture, there are many ways to have bad cultures.  We want Repool to be a transformative, inspiring, and enjoyable place to work, and we're really interested in hiring for other people who feel similarly.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Building great product and moving quickly.</strong>  Our operating philosophy is to seek the truth, debate earnestly, and then - lastly, decide and go.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Becoming more formidable.</strong>  Whether it's in 8 years or 2 years, we know it's unlikely that Repool is the last stop of your life and professional journey.  We care deeply about supporting you in using Repool to get to whatever's next.</li>\n</ul>\n","date_posted":"2023-10-19T22:31:44Z","keywords":["salesforce","fintech"],"source":"Ycombinator"},{"id":"MrJZRKM","role":"Senior Full Stack Engineer","company_name":"SketchDeck HQ","company_num_employees":null,"employment_type":null,"location":null,"remote":true,"logo":"https://findwork-dev-images.s3.amazonaws.com/full/e3ec7708b294b5ddd0f2bae3e580c710a380aa43.jpg","url":"https://findwork.dev/MrJZRKM/senior-full-stack-engineer-at-sketchdeck-hq","text":"<p><strong>About SketchDeck</strong></p><p>SketchDeck is building the model for the next generation of creative agencies.

Increasingly, they solve this challenge by sourcing software from fintechs — companies that specialize in building and operating financial services software. The fintechs can be existing vendors like FIS, Fiserv or Salesforce, newer entrants like nCino, Five9 or Snowflake, and many that are at an earlier stage. Unfortunately, distributing new software to FIs has historically been a long and painful process because of data security and system integration hurdles.</p>\n<p>Sandbox Banking empowers FIs and vendors to quickly and safely build integrations — Glyue lets anyone who can use Excel formulas participate in connecting banking systems making it a multiplayer exercise. Think ‘Turbotax for banking integration’. Furthermore, the platform’s fine-grained authentication and permissions model provides FIs with strict control over which people/software can access particular banking data and operations.</p>\n<p>FIs and fintechs love the platform.

We normalized hour-long commutes, even as private vehicle ownership became the largest source of carbon emission pollution. Our cities blend technology, real estate, and culture to reimagine our daily lives. Come help us make our residents happier, healthier, and more productive in the years they spend with us and the moments they spend together.</p>\n<p><strong>At Culdesac, we:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Work as a team</strong></p>\n<p>Be inclusive, drawing on the strengths of people who bring a different perspective.</p>\n<p>Find ways to work together that overcome disciplinary and geographic separations.</p>\n<p><strong>Ship, including the last 10%</strong></p>\n<p>Be output oriented.
